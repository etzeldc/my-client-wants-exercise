My Client Wants

Hey,

I hope you're doing well.
Just heard from the client.
They're willing to pay us $125/hr to build a site with the following requirements.

A very small header, so that the site mostly shows off the content.
A full-width navbar which sticks to the top of the page when you scroll.
A footer with lots of buttons and images.

Is that cool?

Let me know ASAP.
Thanks!
